# ChatJetpackCompose

This is a Chat app written in Compose to learn compose.

The resources and assets are copied
from [Jetchat](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/tree/main/Jetchat). Just checkout the app
and run.

The app contains a repository to emulate calling backend but network calls are made.
